# scr-cpp-atm-management
This C++ program implements a simple ATM Management System using a class named 'Bank'. Here is an overview of the program:

(1) Project Functionality:
* The program allows users to perform various operations related to a bank account, such as creating an account, checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing 
  money, and canceling the operation.
* It uses a class (Bank) to encapsulate the data and functions related to a bank account.

(2) Usefulness:
* The project serves as a basic example of an ATM Management System, providing a foundation for understanding simple banking operations.
* It can be used as a learning tool for beginners in C++ programming to understand class implementation, user input/output, and basic control flow.

(3) Getting Started:
* Users can get started by compiling and running the C++ program on their local machine.
* Upon running, the program presents a menu with options to perform various banking operations.
* Users can interact with the program by choosing options based on their desired operation.

(4) Getting Help:
* Users can refer to the code comments for explanations of different parts of the program.
* Additional help can be obtained through online C++ programming resources, forums, or documentation.

(5) Maintenance and Contribution:
* As a simple standalone program, maintenance would involve addressing bugs or adding new features.
* Contributions can be made by enhancing the functionality, improving user interface, adding error handling, or incorporating security measures.
* Developers can contribute by forking the project, making changes, and submitting pull requests.

(6) Real-world Scenario:
* In a real-world scenario, this program would need extensive enhancements and security measures.
* Security measures would include implementing authentication, encrypting sensitive data, and validating user inputs to prevent malicious actions.
* The program could be expanded to include a database for storing account information persistently.
